p2p (torrent?) net for sharing artists films/digital media
anyone who contributes can read (create their own frontend/interface/remix)
work in the archive is marked as material or fixed(with display notes)


should we have library cards?
so other sites can embed media but the user puts in their library card to access it...

or just have it as an open api? (rate limits etc)
